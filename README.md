# VersionNotififier
Notifies me whenever my chrome extensions are updated.

For this application to work, you will need to create a config.json file in the root directory.
This file should look like this: 

{
  "gmail":{
    "username": "your_email@gmail.com",
    "password": "your_password",
    "receiver": "whoever_you_want_to_mail@something.com"
  }
}
